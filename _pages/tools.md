## Tools for Security
<b>Digital Identity and Certification.</b> Allow only limited system access to non-certified emails and data file senders. The practice of digital certification is straightforward and can completely eliminate common attack vectors such as phishing and identity fraud. Knowing is half the battle.

<b>Website Securing and Hardening.</b> Many common web frameworks are vulnerable to attack. We take a multi-layered approach to strengthening Websites making them too difficult to attack. This includes choosing appropriate modern tools, using restrictive authorization models, minimizing data exposure and ensuring the latest vendor patches have been applied.

<b>Protection of Client/Partner Data.</b> Implement data security through various security provisions - strong tools, authorization, encryption, appropriate partitioning, data aging and other essential techniques to reduce and eliminate risk of exposure.

<b>Data Backup Coverage.</b> Examine, strengthen and test data and system backup provisions. Proper backups are essential for service recovery after an event. Most companies have never tested their backup and recovery functions.

<b>Firewall Protection.</b> Determine whether your firewall provisions are sufficient. We will configure your firewall(s) to provide least required access privilege, locking down everything except that which is explicitly permitted. We can help you take advantage of the capabilities present in your firewall.

<b>Remote Access.</b> Assist you with the setup of secure remote access for your employees and business partners.

<b>Collaboration Tools.</b> Set up collaboration tools with security and integrity, to eliminate embarrassment or compromise.
