## About Us

<p>
	We are Security experts with decades of experience in maintaining and
	securing computer networks. We are located in the Niagara Region, and
	we are wholly locally owned and operated. We understand the threat that
	hackers represent, and we want to help you to secure your business
	against that threat.
</p>
<p>
	We are not your typical consultants - we understand you need solutions
	now, not strategies for the future. Company IT is typically over-stretched
	and under-resourced, and rightly focussed on revenue earning activity.
	No-one has time for staying on top of the threat landscape. That is
	where we come in. We spend all our time staying on top of security,
	and we bring our expertise, services and solutions to you.
