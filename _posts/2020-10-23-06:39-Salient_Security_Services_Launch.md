Today marks the official launch of the new Salient Security Services 
web site.

This web site is built on a static content platform known as Jekyll,
which uses simple ruby scripts to build a complete web site as static
html and css elements. There is no database, and no server side scripting,
which makes for a light, responsive and secure site, which can be served
from minimal hardware.  This is in keeping with our security philosophy 
of minimising the attack surface and keeping it simple.

We intend to use this blog both to publish trends in the cyber security
world, and to introduce services and tools to our customer and user
community.
